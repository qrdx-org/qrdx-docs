# QRDX Documentation

Welcome to the official QRDX Protocol documentation. QRDX is the first quantum-resistant decentralized exchange protocol with native asset shielding capabilities, built on proven AMM principles and secured by NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography.

## Quick Links

- [Quick Start Guide](getting-started/quick-start.md) - Get started with QRDX in minutes
- [Trading Guide](user-guides/trading.md) - Learn how to trade on QRDX
- [Developer Documentation](dev/api-reference.md) - Build on QRDX
- [Security Overview](security/quantum-resistance.md) - Understand QRDX's quantum resistance

## Core Features

- **Quantum-Resistant Security**: Built with NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptographic algorithms
- **Asset Shielding**: Convert traditional assets to quantum-resistant equivalents (ETH → qETH)
- **High Performance**: 5,000+ TPS with sub-second finality
- **Capital Efficient**: Concentrated liquidity based on Uniswap v3 principles
- **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Secure bridging with quantum-resistant proofs
- **Developer Friendly**: Full EVM compatibility with quantum-resistant extensions
